#+TITLE: flines: plot streamlines in vtk files
#+STARTUP:showall

This is a program for plotting streamlines of 3D vector fields.  

* details
  I integrate streamlines using a 4th order Runge-Kutta solver with
  an adaptive step size; I use linear interpolation to get the values
  of the vector field along the streamline.

  I attempt to cut off the integration when the streamlines either
  close, or become chaotic and unpredictable.  The latter is not
  necessary for still images, but essential for making movies.

  I plot the streamlines using a simple mathematica code.  It builds
  a simple camera matrix and uses it to project the lines onto an
  image plane.  I prefer a short-ish focal length to exaggerate the
  perspective.  I also scale the width and brightness of the lines
  with distance to make them look more 3D.

* usage
  TODO

* status
  This code is an early prototype, and it may never mature beyond
  that.  In particular, it's written for my own working style and for
  the types of data I work with.  I've made no attempt to make this
  generally applicable or in any way user-friendly.

  That being said, you are of course free to use this code if you
  like.  And I welcome patches, bug reports, or feature requests.  At
  the moment, I just don't have the resources to turn this into a
  finished application.
